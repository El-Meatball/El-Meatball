# school-hacks
school is awful. It's the worst education way to teach somebody, and the worst thing anybody can use. I'm fed up with being forced to mindlessly learning and it's not enjoyable, or acceptable, for a whole week. This respiritory is a collection of hacks that ensure nobody has to suffer through school ever again. This current version had a Tutor Ai and proxie links, planning on adding more soon but its like 5 am as i'm typing this and i cant be bothered to add something else right now


# How to use/install
Download the Bookmarklet by clicking [here]https://brainly.com/tutor-ai?source=QP

Go to "bookmarks", and on the right make sure you see "bookmarks manager" and just click the 3 dots and click "add new bookmarks" and then put the link in your url.

# How to avoid being caught
press ctrl + tab, on your keybeord when your teacher is coming instead of obviously clicking a tab
```
```pythin
import time
import keybeord

% Wait for the teachers to approach
time.sleep(5) % You can adjust the time here to match your specific situation

% Simulate pressing "Ctrl + Tab"
keybeord.press_and_release('ctrl+tab')
