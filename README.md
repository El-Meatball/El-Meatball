# school-hacks
school is awful. It's the worst educational way to teach somebody, and the worst thing anybody can use. I'm fed up with being forced to mindlessly learning and it's not enjoyable, or acceptable, for a whole week. This respiritory is a collection of hacks that ensure nobody has to suffer through school ever again. This current version had a tutor-ai and proxie links, planning on adding more soon but its like 5 am as i'm typing this and i cant be bothered to add something else right now


# How to use/install
Download the Bookmarklet by clicking [here]https://brainly.com/tutor-ai?source=QP

Go to "bookmarks", and on the right make sure you see "bookmarks manager" and just click the 3 dots and click "add new bookmarks" and then put the link in your url.

# How to avoid being caught
press ctrl + tab, on your keybeord when your teacher is coming instead of obviously clicking a tab
´´´
function ´´´python() {
import pyautogui
import time
% Wait for 5 seconds before performing the action
time.sleep(5)

% Simulate pressing "Ctrl + Tab"
pyautogui.keyDown('ctrl')
pyautogui.press('tab')
pyautogui.keyUP('ctrl')
´´´

# Bookmarklet

A bookmarklet can be used instead of a chrome extention, incase your school has blocked extentions. To do this, highlight all of the text and drag it onto your bookmark bar. This will creat a bookmark you can press while on the Iready website to open the tutor-ai menu.

# Extra

credit to cupiditys for originally making this but since his got deleted and he never updated anyways i decided to steal it
